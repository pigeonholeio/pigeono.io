# How you can help

🚀🫶 Thanks for your interest in supporting the project! 🫶 🚀

The project is in its infancy so any help is greatly appreciated. Your involvement keeps the gears turning and motivation for maintaining the service. Here's how you can make an impact:
## Easy Wins 🎉
Sometimes, the smallest actions make the biggest difference!

### ⭐ Star Us on GitHub:
A simple star shows your love for the project and boosts visibility. It’s like giving us a virtual high-five!

All you have to do is head over to [github.com/pigeonholeio/pigeonhole-cli](https://github.com/pigeonholeio/pigeonhole-cli){:target="_blank"}, make sure you're logged in and star it in the top right-hand corner 👍

### 🍺 Buy Me a Beer:
Developing, mainting and paying the AWS costs takes time, energy and money - Fuel my coding sessions by buying me a beer.    

All you have to do is click this button, decide how many beers you'd like to buy me and follow the instructions:
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.buymeacoffee.com/1.0.0/button.prod.min.js" data-name="bmc-button" data-slug="pigeonholeio" data-color="#FFDD00" data-emoji="🍺"  data-font="Cookie" data-text="Buy me a Beer!" data-outline-color="#000000" data-font-color="#000000" data-coffee-color="#ffffff" ></script>


### 📨 Send a Secret
Sending a secret using the tool is as simple as it gets. Simply using the tool increases my motivation and validates the service to keep it going.
