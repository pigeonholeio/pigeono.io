# How you can help

🚀🫶 Thanks for your interest in supporting the project! 🫶 🚀

The project is in its infancy so any help is greatly appreciated. Your involvement keeps the gears turning and gives me the motivation to maintain the service. Here's how you can make an impact:
## Easy Wins 🎉
Sometimes, the smallest actions make the biggest difference!

### ⭐ Star Us on GitHub
A simple star shows your love for the project and boosts visibility. It’s like giving us a virtual high-five!

All you have to do is head over to [github.com/pigeonholeio/pigeonhole-cli](https://github.com/pigeonholeio/pigeonhole-cli){:target="_blank"}, make sure you're logged in and star it in the top right-hand corner 👍

### 🍺 Buy Me a Beer
Developing, maintain and paying the AWS costs takes time, energy and money. You can fuel my coding sessions by buying me a beer
