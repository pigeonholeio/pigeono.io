# Self-Hosted Install

Self-hosting PigeonHole has been a core design goal from day one. Every line of code, every technology choice, and every configurable option was carefully selected to make running your own instance not just possible â€” but smooth and flexible.

The tool and API are built to integrate seamlessly with your existing infrastructure, leveraging interoperable services and standards to ensure maximum adaptability.

That said, supporting a self-hosted version alongside the online service is a significant commitment. At this time, I'm unable to provide official support or SLA guarantees for self-hosted deployments.

However, if you're interested, please reach out. Depending on demand and use case, I'm open to exploring tailored options on a case-by-case basis. Your feedback could be the catalyst to making self-hosted PigeonHole a fully supported reality.
