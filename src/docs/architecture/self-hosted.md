# Self-Hosted Install

It has been a core design goal of PigeonHole from day one to build for a self-hosted and vendor agnostic model.
Every line of code, every technology choice, and every configurable option was carefully chosen to ensure an instance you can deploy making it not just possible — but flexible and easy to deploy.

If you have a specific implementation use case, I'm open to exploring tailored options on a case-by-case basis. 
Your feedback could be the catalyst to making self-hosted PigeonHole a fully supported reality.
