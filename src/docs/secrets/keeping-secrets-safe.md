# Unlocking Trust: How GPG & OpenPGP Power PigeonHole's Zero-Trust Security

When you send something sensitive online — whether it's a confidential contract, login credentials, or an API key — there's an unspoken moment of trust. You rely on the platform, the transport method, and the storage system to protect your data from prying eyes. But what if you couldn't fully trust any of those layers?

**PigeonHole** takes a Zero Trust approach.  
_We want your data to be safe even if you don't trust the internet._

This radical level of security is made possible by leveraging the power of **GPG** and the **OpenPGP** standard.

## Why Traditional Encryption Isn't Enough

Most file sharing or secret management tools encrypt your data during transmission and while it sits on their servers. This protects against casual snooping and many common threats.

However, those services still **hold the keys** — literally. They manage your encryption keys behind the scenes, which means:

- If their infrastructure is compromised, your secrets can be exposed.  
- They may be legally compelled to hand over data or keys.  
- Human error or misconfiguration can accidentally leak sensitive information.

In essence, the “trusted” provider can become the weakest link in your security chain.

## What Is OpenPGP and Why Does It Matter?

**OpenPGP** is an open, well-established standard designed to protect digital communication and data. It defines how encryption, decryption, and digital signatures work together to secure information.

**GPG** (GNU Privacy Guard) is the free, open-source implementation of OpenPGP. It's trusted worldwide by privacy advocates, journalists, software developers, and governments to keep communications confidential and verifiable.

Here's the core of how it works:

- You generate a **key pair**: a public key and a private key.  
- The **public key** is shared openly and used to encrypt messages or files.  
- The **private key** remains secret with you, used to decrypt what's been encrypted with your public key.  
- You can also digitally **sign** messages with your private key to prove authenticity.

This setup means that **only you can read messages encrypted with your public key**, ensuring true end-to-end security.

## How PigeonHole Harnesses GPG & OpenPGP

At PigeonHole, we integrate GPG seamlessly into the user experience so you don't have to become a crypto expert to benefit from strong encryption.

- Every user seamlessly registers a **public key** with PigeonHole
- When you send a secret, your client software encrypts it **locally** using the recipient's public key.  
- The encrypted data is then stored securely on PigeonHole servers — but without access to any private keys, no one can decrypt it with the level of crypto tuning we put into the encryption.  
- When the recipient wants to retrieve the secret, they use their private key locally to decrypt it.

    The private keys never leave your machines!


## Why This Level of Security Matters

By building on GPG and OpenPGP, PigeonHole achieves:

- **True end-to-end encryption** where data is never accessible in plaintext to intermediaries.  
- A **zero-trust architecture**, meaning you don't have to trust PigeonHole to keep your secrets safe — mathematically, it's impossible for us to decrypt your data.  
- **Cryptographic proof** that your data has not been altered or tampered with, thanks to digital signatures - think built in checksums!  
- Flexibility to securely share secrets with users whether or not they've set up their keys yet.

## The Bigger Picture: Privacy by Design

PigeonHole's use of GPG and OpenPGP aligns with modern privacy principles:

- **Minimal trust assumptions** — trust the math, not the platform.  
- **Separation of duties** — encryption keys are controlled by users, not the service provider.  
- **Transparency** — open standards and open-source software underpin the security model.

This gives you the confidence that your most sensitive secrets stay just that — yours.

## In Summary

GPG and OpenPGP aren't just complex crypto acronyms; they are the foundation of secure, verifiable communication trusted globally.  

PigeonHole brings these powerful technologies into an elegant, user-friendly platform that protects your secrets with cryptographic rigor — no compromises, no backdoors, no surprises.

When security matters, and trust is scarce, PigeonHole makes sure your secrets truly belong to you.
